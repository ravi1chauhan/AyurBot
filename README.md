# AyurBot

- AyurBot is an intelligent chatbot designed to provide personalized recommendations on Ayurvedic wellness practices.
- With AyurBot, you can access the benefits of Ayurveda from the comfort of your own home, 24/7.
- It is built using cutting-edge technologies such as Flask, NLTK, Keras, Python, and others.
- AyurBot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand and interpret user input, allowing it to provide customized guidance to users.
- AyurBot's user-friendly interface makes it easy to interact with user experience.
- Technologies used - ```Flask```, ```NLTK```, ```Keras```, and ```Python```

**About AyurBot:**<br/>
- In my Python web-based project, I have created a AyurBot(chatbot) that employs advanced deep learning and Flask techniques. The AyurBot(chatbot) is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising categories (intents), patterns, and corresponding responses. To classify the user's message into the appropriate category, I have implemented a sophisticated artificial neural network (ANN). Once the message is categorized, the AyurBot(chatbot) selects a random response from the list of possible responses for that category. This approach ensures that the AyurBot(chatbot) can effectively engage with users and respond appropriately to their queries.

**The Dateset:**<br/>
- The dataset that I have utilize in my AyurBot(chatbot) is stored in a JSON file named 'data.json'. This JSON file contains a comprehensive list of patterns that the chatbot will identify, and their corresponding responses that will be returned to the user. By leveraging the data stored in 'data.json', our chatbot will be able to engage with users effectively and provide relevant responses based on their queries.

**Prerequisites:**<br/>
- To undertake this project, it is essential to possess a solid understanding of Python programming, Keras deep learning framework, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Additionally, I have employed several helper modules, which can be downloaded using the python-pip command. To install these dependencies, execute the following commands:
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install pickle
pip install nltk
pip install flask
```

These modules are crucial to the chatbot's functionality and enable us to streamline the development process, achieve optimal performance, and create a highly responsive and effective chatbot that can interact with users seamlessly.
